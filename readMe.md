# Motion Prediction in Autonomous Vehicles
Exploring various methods to predict the motion of autonomous vehicles in presence of multiple agents

This repository is a compilation of the various approaches we used in the Kaggle Competition: <br>
[Lyft Motion Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lyft-motion-prediction-autonomous-vehicles/) <br>
Goal of the competition: To built robust motion prediction models for self-driving vehicles. <br>

[Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/) has the largest publicly available dataset for this purpose: [Dataset](https://self-driving.lyft.com/level5/prediction/) <br> 
A shortened Kaggle-friendly version of the same is available in the [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lyft-motion-prediction-autonomous-vehicles/data) section on the main page.

## If you were to attempt the competition problem statement yourself: 

Following points might help you go ahead and make a baseline submission: <br>
  1. To understand the dataset structure clearly, watch this: [Intro](https://vimeo.com/451293003)
  2. Working with data can be difficult at the start. You might visit the [L5Kit](https://github.com/lyft/l5kit) repo for sample codes and jupyter notebooks.
     I'd recommend you to try and run those notebooks yourself to get a decent idea about the dataset structure.
